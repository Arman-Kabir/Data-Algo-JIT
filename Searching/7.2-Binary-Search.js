// Binary Search will take less time than the linear search
/*
    Requirements of BS is - ****array should be sorted. But, That is not a case in linear search.

    *** BS algorithm is divide and conquer technique.It means it will divide the array into two halves.
    *Recursively divide the array into sub-arrays.

    *We'r going to find the middle element of the array.For this, we take two variables
     - left and right variables. Left at 0 and Right at n-1. Mid = floor(L+R)/2

    If the data is not sorted , then u can't apply binary search on that array. First, sort the array.
     Then     u can apply BS on that array.
